## About

[ShareChess](https://sharechess.github.io/) is a free, open source website that allows you to share chess games as self-contained replay links (the whole game is stored in the url without the need for a database), PNG images, or GIF / MP4 / WebM animations.

The website provides a high variety of chessboard and piece designs to serve as an open alternative for commercial chess GIF makers.
